Mostly they just want the town to follow its own formally-adopted plans, produced at great expense and with much public participation, and not discard them whenever a developer comes along wanting to do something different.

You can look up their funding sources -- all open and transparent to the public view. I believe the TBB/NEXTettes are well-funded also -- are you equally critical of them? And they're not so transparent. How could Chapel Hill possibly be stuck in the past when, over the 30+ years I've lived here, it's changed enormously? If you're referring to the upzoning, rest assured that the infill housing constructed under that ordinance will be market-rate and expensive -- not affordable and inclusive. We are moving towards more rich enclaves in CH, not fewer. If you support an exclusive town dominated by the profit-margins of developers, built for wealthy people at the expense of good environmental practices and lower-income communities, then vote for Anderson and her dark money allies.",

The beginning of the Town's efforts to shape the form and rate of growth\u2014as opposed to giving builders free rein\u2014is roughly contemporaneous with the completion of I-40 from Hillsborough to southwest Durham. Both occurred in the mid-80s. In all the time I've been here new housing has been built every year (except perhaps during recessions) so the idea that CH has ever had a no-growth policy is just a canard with no basis in fact. Indeed, the establishment of the rural buffer in 1988\u2014which you might consider a \"no-growth policy\"\u2014was followed just a few years later by approval of a large new  housing development called Southern Village. The projects that get challenged are those that seek rezoning to build at greater density than existing zoning allows, that is, they are proposing marked increases in land-use intensity, which often entails adverse impacts on the residents of adjacent properties as well as imposing costs on the town as a whole\u2014more roads to maintain, more public safety staff needed, more water-absorbing landscape paved over, more traffic congestion. If developers were content to build according to existing zoning approval would be fairly straightforward and council meetings would be even more boring than they are currently. Your characterization of housing market dynamics considers only one half of the equation\u2014supply\u2014but neglects the role of demand. Clearly, if lowering housing prices was merely a matter of increasing supply then NYC would have the cheapest house prices in the country. It does not. And building thousands of new housing units in CH over the past several years has done nothing to lower local housing costs. In fact, by displacing older, modestly priced housing, as occurred on Ephesus Road, the new apartments have had exactly the opposite effect. So it's all quite complex and I expect we will continue to debate the best path forward in the years to come.",

    "comment": " Yes, that was exactly my point above. To talk intelligently about housing prices you need to consider not only supply but also demand. And maybe it would make sense for local government to try to coordinate what they do on the supply side with what they do on the demand side. For example,  if housing costs are unaffordable because the number of people employed in town (i.e., demand) far exceeds the number of housing units the town supplies, then maybe, in addition to building more housing, we ought to think twice about increasing the number of local jobs (e.g., building large new wetlab office space downtown), so that the effect of the latter on housing costs won't simply cancel out the effect of the former. But the idea that we might want slower, or even negative local job growth is practically anathema among most of those who think about these issues. Rather our local government takes it for granted that they ought to be both combatting the high cost of housing and increasing the number of local job opportunities (\"economic development\"), even though increasing jobs simply exacerbates the gap between housing demand and supply, putting further upward pressure on housing prices. The right hand and the left hand are working at cross purposes, so we shouldn't be surprised when our town government's supply-side efforts fail to make housing more affordable.",

    "comment": " I was a UNC undergrad when the rural buffer was established and paid about as much attention at the time to land-use planning as do today's undergrads. In the years since, however, I have learned that there are actually two different rural buffers, each established for somewhat different reasons. The buffer north of Chapel Hill and Carrboro was indeed established to prevent sprawl: \"The genesis of this initiative was the realization that new development in that part of the county closest to Carrboro and Chapel Hill would, if left unchecked, result in extensive low-density sprawl that would greatly diminish the rural character of this area, creating chaotic and disorganized development patterns that would be hugely expensive to serve with public water and sewer.\" (https://cwp.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Orange-Countys-Rural-Buffer-REV.-3.13.19.pdf). Maximum density here was set at one dwelling per 2 acres. The buffer on the west side of Carrboro is the University Lake watershed. At the time, University Lake was Chapel Hill's and Carrboro's only source of drinking water and this buffer was established to protect drinking water quality. Maximum density here was set at one dwelling unit per 5 acres. I disagree with the claim that the townsfolk failed to keep up their end of the policy by building enough housing within the municipal service boundary, though we commonly hear this assertion from developers who want the town to grant them windfall profits by rezoning land for higher density use. I disagree because in the years since the buffer was established the towns have approved new housing on just about every acre of previously undeveloped land, including very large projects such as Southern Village and Meadowmont which, at the time they were constructed, were denser than just about anything else being built in the area. As a result, Chapel Hill and Carrboro are among the densest cities in the state. And I can count on one hand the number of new housing applications that Chapel Hill town government has denied over the past 30 years.",

He has also voted to streamline our affordable housing development process to make projects easier to build. He supports the efforts of St. Paul's AME church to build affordable. He is also seeking other sources of funding for affordable housing and is eager to bring UNC to the table for discussions of this issue.",

Better to be sure before making claims. Parks are part of the recreational infrastructure which the town is not attending to sufficiently as it grows. I've spoken to parents whose children play field sports and they're having to drive their kids to other towns where there are adequate fields. This hardly disincentivizes driving. Parks are essential to environmental and community health. Being \"not last in park space\" is hardly a compliment. And what's the point of such a metric anyway? Remember also that the Complete Community ideal pushed by the consultant Jennifer Keesmaat and her admirers requires easily accessible parks to foster \"completion.\"",

Some also limit deforestation (or require some replacement of canopy, hardwood trees (Carrboro does have that, but when  the ENTIRE lot comprises only the house, there are no remaining places to plant trees).  There are other zoning laws which can also help to maintain nice, relatively affordable, integrated neighborhoids/towns, and limit these grotesque, obscene monstrosities in neighborhoods with older, smaller, cuter homes.  It should be  about maintaining character, habitats, and RELATIVE affordability.  When big money and greedy builders take over and neighborhoods are destroyed (and made unaffordable for the majority of people),a town can and should step in and make changes.

How many cities that sprung up during the industrial revolution are prosperous today? Relatively speaking they are all shells of their former selves. Even the California cities that rapidly grew rapidly in the 20th century have peaked - there is no \"rush\" to \"make it big\" in California like there once was. \n\nOnce this place is stripped of its charm and affordability entirely, the husk will be discarded and a new community will be exploited.\n\nGrowth can be good and is certainly better than decline, but it's taken on a fever pitch here recently.

It is continuing the low-density, high-wealth only development that is the only functional building type allowed in most of Carrboro right now. Adding density means putting more units on the land in SMALLER homes that are affordable to people at a wider portion of the economic spectrum. Have you seen the two new million dollar houses on Gary Rd? If not, go check them out. Both houses are around 3,600 square feet in size and will have mortgage payments of $6,000 to $8,000 per month. Then go up to the corner of Davie and Poplar and check out the fourplex in this picture. This fourplex is 3,500 square feet. (and notice the trees, there are plenty) Each of those apartments in the fourplex rents for $1,200 to $1,500 a month and is home to usually two people. When you hear those of us who advocate for more density and Missing Middle housing, this is what we are talking about. More of the picture below, and fewer homes that only multi-millionaires can afford. And I would encourage you to read what I wrote on the election earlier this week. In order to get fewer million dollar trophy homes and more affordable places to live, we need to TAKE ACTION with our zoning code. The candidates mentioned in this thread are largely running on PREVENTING ACTIONS, mostly in the northern portion of town.

    "comment": " I think we have a faulty understanding of the power of the planning board given the underlying zoning regulations in place in Carrboro. Big houses? Well it\u2019s impossible to build multi family housing on the majority of land in town. So builders build what 1) is easy to build given our underlying rules and 2) will make the most money. So unless you change zoning, we\u2019re going to get giant houses. In the last 20 years the council has tried to change this a little by giving developers density bonuses\u2014 you can build more houses in less space but you need to make some affordable. But, as you noted, this plan has mainly given us car oriented suburban development on greenfields in the north of town. \nDo Mills and Wade have a plan to do something different? How do you do \u201cslow growth\u201d in a town that has redefined slow? Is their answer just don\u2019t build anything?",

(see pic below or go visit instagram) My entire blog post linked above is written based on the public statements of the candidates communicating their priorities. Wade's statements are mostly about high-level topics that could mean a lot of things, or nothing at all, like \"hold developers accountable.\" And sure, if the Town Council is facing a developer with a conditional use zoning application, there is the opportunity to negotiate. But the teardown situations everyone is lamenting in this thread ARE NOT those situations, and we can't \"get tough with developers\" to fix it. The teardowns are situations where the existing regulations allow for million dollar homes by right and don't allow smaller, more affordable homes that happen to share attached walls (duplexes, triplexes, quadplexes, etc). Our ordinance economically INCENTIVIZES THE TEARDOWNS. To fix this situation we have to change the development ordinances, which is exactly what Catherine Fray is running to do. They decided to run because a lot of her time on the Planning Board was spent banging their head against the wall and not seeing enough change happening.

I've put the link below. Housing for those below 30% of the area median income, and to a lesser extent between 30% and 60% of the median income, is going to require significant subsidy in the form of municipal tax budgets to supplement the few federal dollars (and ZERO state dollars) that are coming. I see nuance in these income ranges. But above the 60% AMI level, supply growth is going to slow the raising of rents. https://www.pewtrusts.org/en/research-and-analysis/articles/2023/04/17/more-flexible-zoning-helps-contain-rising-rents#:~:text=More%20households%20require%20more%20homes,in%20to%20fill%20the%20homes.",

    "comment": " I don't fully understand your question but I think it's about space and money. IMO my question hits the mark in terms of lived experience and still-powerful cultural narratives. I work with young people and talk to them all the time -- interesting that many aren't looking to stay or settle in CH: their reasons are mostly that there's nothing for them to do here and housing is too expensive. The \"standalone house with a yard\" is still very much the \"aspiration\" of \"younger generations.\" It's an aspiration embedded in our culture as an enduring route to wealth-building and a sign of worldly success. Ownership is part of American identity. Remember also that our economic structures offer us not much of a social safety net, so owning property is an important way to provide for one's old age. These issues complicate the statistics and reveal what they can't. The adult daughter of a friend of mine is a successful professional who rents an apartment. She recently got engaged and plans to have a family. She and her fiancee aim to give up their apartment and buy a single-family home in order to achieve this goal. I think for people fortunate enough to be middle-class this narrative is still very compelling -- problematic but compelling There are different kinds of households, as you observe, but the traditional association of apartment-dwelling with temporary stages in the lives of the young remains. And it seems to me, looking around at all this expensive housing, that the intent of the CHTC and its developer allies is to build a town for high earners -- a place attractive to those people who used to be called, when you were young, Yuppies. Those who earn less, have less, and live in straitened circumstances will likely be pushed out as these, probably mostly tech, workers come to town.",

    "comment": " First, I want to say that while it's clear you and I have disagreements, you've been a positive contributor to a healthy discussion here, and whether or not we agree, you certainly have my respect. Thank you! The successful young woman you describe is ONE of the many kinds of people for whom we need apartments. And you note that when she and her fiance marry (congrats!) they will seek a single family home. (As my wife and I did; I have lived this story, too) Where will they be living while they save for a down payment? An apartment! But while that life path is a perfectly good choice, it is increasingly a less common one. Your post also encapsulates the problem the young face quite well. There's \"nothing for them to do here\" and the cost of housing is expensive. When you see me and others advocating for greater density, more housing to support local retail, less parking to allow more building space to hold more job opportunities (which are something to do here), what we are trying to do is to let Chapel Hill and Carrboro be a place that our kids may choose to stay in or return to after graduation because it is attractive and affordable. But there's also a fundamental question of racial equity here. If you pull the Census Data for Carrboro, you'll find that there are 3000 white households that own a home and 3400 that rent. About 47% of white Carrboro residents are homeowners. About 53% rent. Meanwhile, 230 black households own a home while 1150 rent. This means that 84% of black households are renters, many of them living in apartments. We could spend a long time discussing the systemic racism that has undercut minority homeownership in the US, but for our present-day decisionmaking, the functional outcome locally is that when we prevent apartments from being built in Chapel Hill and Carrboro, we're reducing the availability of the housing type that is doing the best job of giving many minority residents attainable access to the amenities our community offers, including our excellent school system, Chapel Hill Transit, job opportunities and libraries. This is why we need to build more homes, smaller homes, duplexes, quadplexes, and apartments. We can't house a future population that is 80% non-nuclear families with single family houses built for two parents and 2-3 kids.",

    "comment": " I respect your views as well, even if I don't agree. Conversations on this forum that explore the complexities of such issues are important, I think. A few things: My friend's daughter and her fiancee are very well-paid professionals who already have a down-payment for a home. They're extremely fortunate. The young people I've spoken to who complain that there's nothing to do here meant extra-mural activities. They go to Raleigh and Durham to find the social scenes and activities they like, preferring not to stay in what's becoming a corporate town. I'm not against the building of apartments -- they're an important part of the housing stock, obviously. But in order to have real equity we must stress ownership along with affordability. I don't like the way we're building -- these mammoth structures are warehouse-like blocks for housing the workforce needed by the investor class which is coming to dominate this area. They are not for the poor or vulnerable, or even those of moderate income. I don't think a boom in duplexes etc. will change this -- I think those duplexes etc. will sell for market rate and gentrification will result. More rich enclaves, which reinforce class and wealth inequality. Finally, my own adult child, who was born here, considered moving back to settle, looked around and decided against it. Like many people, he's looking for a smaller town with less traffic to call home. IMO our rapid and ungainly urbanization will turn people off and we will lose many of the features that made CH attractive in the first place. One of the downsides of growth.",

    "comment": " I think the process is actually the other way around: developers propose developments that either comply with current zoning rules or need modifications. The council may want certain types of development but they can only approve or deny what is proposed. They often ask for and get minor changes in proposals, but they aren\u2019t actively developing anything themselves. And developers aren\u2019t going to propose anything truly different or innovative because the process isn\u2019t friendly to differences. Infill has been a stated priority for the past two decades, but very little of it has happened because the underlying zoning rules have stayed the same. In other words, we forgot to turn off the suburb machine running in the background and now we have a whole bunch of new suburbs because the machine makes it easier to convert fields and forests into homes than anything else. It\u2019s time to turn off the suburb machine and turn on the infill machine",

A bus does not even come close enough for me to take  into Town to walk and shop. The planning for our town and community has been sorely lacking.

Coal ash was widely used because it is considered stronger and easier to work with than other materials. The availability and often low cost of coal ash made the product attractive to developers and landowners, especially during the 1980s and 1990s. \n\nWhile DEQ has mapped the known locations of coal ash structural fills, there were few rules or records regarding the use of coal ash as fill prior to 1987. Coal ash used as structural fill was not required to be reported to the state environmental agency until 1994.",

What I love about April Mill\u2019s experience and approach is that she attends Intercity Trips annually which travels to different cities which have faced similar challenges to workshop what worked and what didn\u2019t and exchange ideas with leadership. I think this wisdom-seeking approach would be helpful on the Carrboro town council. She also is very well connected across the state which helps build bridges (so to speak) and to be aware and seek partnership opportunities.",

What is the point of building masses of new housing if it's all expensive, displaces the people who already live here, and discourages future residents of low- to moderate-income? Why do you think that density will decrease sprawl? We have both -- the density itself is sprawling. New construction provides hundreds of parking spaces for cars -- how does this disincentivize driving? How can a town whose infrastructure can't keep up with its population growth be called \"fully urbanized\"? CH is neither a city nor a town -- it's a sprawling hybrid unable to be either. We don't \"have to accept\" -- we can use our vote to bring change. It's possible to control growth and approach it circumspectly. Better decisions can be made by more thoughtful leaders. Please check out the websites of the council candidates to get the specifics of their platforms.",

I would much rather have a two or 3ir4 story shopping center like streets of south point than the huge expansive unwalkable Crossroads in Raleigh. And huge parking lots costing thousand millions of $$ create multiple problems, trees lost, stormwater problems. New housing is full, taken, because we have had a shortage of building diversity of housing for many years. The town is actively working on limiting parking and providing other options.  There are so many people now biking and busing into UNC, the hospital, hundreds of people a day. This is definitely helping - can you imagine what the traffic would be like if all those people were trying to drive to work. \n  What to do about so many people moving into NC?  I dont know.

The Aura development on Estes/MLK will add thousands of new car trips through that already busy intersection every day. It includes spaces for about 600 cars. Free busses are great and I'm all in favor of bus riding -- but there's a shortage of drivers and the challenge of taking the bus with heavy grocery bags etc. Service is also being cut back: the bus that serves my area used to run every half-hour and now runs once an hour. I also wonder why we're building a town for people who aren't here while so many of those who are here go unheard. People have a choice of where to move -- and I'm hearing more about people not wanting to stay or settle here. The traffic is a nightmare, despite all the bicycling.",

However, as part of the planning board, Catherine has supported the outdated connector roads policy which requires vehicle connectivity everywhere. This promotes status quo car use and therefore discourages biking and walking. Catherine actually proposed the town go as far as to prohibit bollards or any obstacles that block the free flow of vehicle traffic. There is simply no way that requiring car infrastructure supports a non car transportation system. Cities with progressive transportation plans are looking at ways to emphasize car alternatives by discouraging car use. Look up \"low traffic neighborhoods\" being explored in England, and how the government in Paris shut down an entire freeway to cars, dedicating it for bicycle and pedestrian use. Jason hasn\u2019t voiced his opinion on this. Given he\u2019s a big cyclist, I\u2019d imagine he doesn\u2019t like this policy, but he also said at the NEXT candidate interview event that he\u2019ll look to Catherine for how to make decisions. Eliazar has been a little less clear on his enthusiasm for cars, but he tends to vote with the sitting council who support this policy.",

Many neighborhoods have more of a cul de sac model and cars have to drive all the way back in order to exit. Also can make it more difficult for firetrucks and emergency vehicles.  Since both those candidates are very pro bike and transit and have a lot of knowledge about transportation, it might be helpful to hear why car connectivity is important. Also, what i have seen in Paris is connectivity everywhere, but they have added bike lanes, closed some lanes to cars and they have huge bus and metro system. In Carrboro, imagine if Gates Farm rd and Stratford dr were closed off at Homestead Rd and you had to drive all the way back to Gates Farm to exit at Hillsborough rd. Way too much driving More protected bikelanes and greenways will greatly enhance cycling or ebike use",

Kramer, dissing a member of CHALT for living in Chatham County when she herself lives in Carrboro and feels free to sound off loudly and often about Chapel Hill political life. There is no \"NIMBY club\" -- there's a lot of people in CH who disagree with the TBB bloggers and the NEXTettes and are working to bring positive change. Plenty of popularity there.",

The building would be the tallest in Chapel Hill, though the ordinance prescribes a maximum for this zone of six stories.  The town planning commission recommends the town council approve this project. \n\nIf you have concerns or want to know more about this project, please write the council members! On the town council website you will find emails for individual members. I recommend sending a note to individuals, rather than to the group email address. I learned in connection with the rezoning proposal that some of the council members discount or even disregard emails that come to the group address. That in itself is a sad comment.",

Sounds great in theory (as so many things in graduate school do) but very flawed in practice. We know well that this economic model doesn't work. There's nothing to stop developers from buying up cheaper housing when the wealthy (all at once and seemingly by magic) depart for new luxury housing. Flip the old stock and charge market prices for what was affordable. This makes economic sense and is the kind of move encouraged by our capitalist model. Gentrification. Displacement. Money continuing to flow to the top. More rich enclaves where we expected affordability. You say you earn above AMI -- you won't be eligible for the affordable units in the new building and my guess is you don't make enough to buy/rent the market price ones. I am in a similar position so I know what I'm talking about. It's possible that you (and I) might be able to afford something in about 10 years time, when research has shown that some filtering might happen. Nothing is affordable now to those of low, moderate, or average income -- believe me, I've looked. We must wait while already-wealthy investors clean up.",

What do you do when a student of yours works so hard to misunderstand the state of the research to score political points? \n\nA better analogy would be to think of shoes. We have an economy where regulation has mad shoe manufacture really onerous. We don\u2019t have a lot of new shoes coming to market. The rich outbid others for the existing shoes and drive the prices of shoes up. Some shoes, formerly owned by workers are bought by the rich and re-soled. Some people don\u2019t even have shoes.  Amazingly, a cobbler says that they are willing to make some shoes, even though the town has made cobbling such a hassle. They make 100 pairs, 75 of which are really fancy shoes and 25 are just plain kicks. Rich people buy the fancy shoes. People who make 80% of regional AMI buy the other 25. Some local curmudgeons who are obsessed with shoes are bummed out that all the shoes aren\u2019t affordable. They think getting 0 total affordable shoes is better than a situation where 25 people get affordable shoes. After all, they really hate the greedy cobblers and they complain about rich people with fancy shoes, even though many also have fancy shoes. Regardless, the town goes ahead and makes the shoes. Interestingly, when the Rick people buy the fancy new shoes, they aren\u2019t buying the old shoes off of workers feet anymore. So the workers actually have more shoes than they did before the fancy shoes came to market. \n\nLet\u2019s make more shoes. Of all types. Chucks. Pumps. Flip flops. Boots. \n\nLet\u2019s go!",

    "comment": " In my experience few people are actually \"anti-development.\" I'm hoping that voting in new town leadership will bring a more thoughtful, balanced, and fully democratic approach to growth. As for your comment about homeowners thwarting development for their own (implicitly selfish) reasons -- there's so much more to it. A home is an investment that most people save for and rely on to see them through old age. This cultural and ideological emphasis on ownership is problematical in many ways but it is deeply entrenched. Would a younger generation want to support through their taxes older people without savings to rely on? But how does this younger generation get access to property within a system that favors only the very wealthy? Someone must be blamed. Within the capitalist mindset and in accordance with the free-market logic so trusted by new urbanists, it makes sense for those who invested in their homes -- and the communities they've helped to build -- to hold on to them now, as prices soar. No-one wants to be destitute. Should ordinary people be criticized for doing what their society tells them makes economic sense -- a society that offers very little social safety net? The situation is very difficult. IMO our current model of capitalism is eroding the middle-classes, enriching the wealthiest, and training up a workforce to serve the needs of the 1%. Nice for Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos et al. But this idea of homeowners selfishly withholding a kind of inheritance from newcomers/renters is a straw man -- an old trope which permits a very complex field of contradictory energies to be simplified and thus made manageable. It's an idea that also fosters the politics of resentment and division.",

They would be a good investment because there is insufficient supply. \n\nThe analogy works quite well. It also explains other aspects of our housing market well. Lots of people are stuck in shoes that no longer fit because they have a hard time finding the right sized shoes in the limited selection we have available. Most modern people have smaller feet but, because we don\u2019t make many new shoes, the average old shoe size doesn\u2019t fit the new residents. \n\nShould I continue?",

An example of what you described was achieved with the first Form Based Code apartment building, which caused the assessment for the adjacent Village Gate shopping center to double. The increased tax drove out the thrift shop and all the locally owned businesses, which were replaced with chain stores. Similarly, the Northside neighborhood\u2019s tax assessments have multiplied as a result of adjacent development.  This is the town\u2019s stated goal (Dwight Bassett presented the goal to Planning Board in 2011, so a long view shows how the town planned and achieved it).",

Trickle down housing, like trickle down economics was a hoax. CH has had more than 5 years of building luxury apartments, and it has not resulted in lower rents or affordable housing. In fact, it has made it possible for lower priced developments all over CH to increase their rents.  Look at the number of people who have had to accept large rent increases or move out; many of whom have ended up asking for help, or information about lower priced rentals right here on NextDoor. Did you not see all of the complaints on this platform about rent increases?  What it has done is contribute to the massive property tax that we have--and the tax hikes that will will continue to have for the next several year, along with heat zones and traffic congestion.",

This is such an excellent example of exactly what we should do! Developers don't build housing without profit as a motive, that's obvious. Absent profit, they don't build. Developers will NEVER build housing that is 100% affordable units. Government will have to do that and they have not done a thing. Moreover, segregation of affordable housing is an overwhelmingly bad thing. Neighborhoods have been shown to be healthier when there is a great mix of affordable units and market rate units.

From an economic/political/cultural pov it's just obvious that the policies we're pursuing -- basically build high-end and build until affordability somehow emerges and the housing crisis somehow goes away -- will simply not serve the populations that most need serving: low to moderate income people. They're not actually meant to. Previous injustices will not be addressed by policies like upzoning because these will create class and income segregation: mixed housing, good idea, but you've got to be rich already to buy/rent it. More wealthy neighborhoods -- but the mixed-style housing box will be ticked. Even the CHTC acknowledged that upzoning is not an address to affordability. IMO this is utopian thinking -- it believes too much in free market forces. And why should developers be able to prioritize their profit-making as the one piece of the housing puzzle that can't be questioned or changed? Let the wealthy take a hit for a change -- tax the rich! Let's have more than a measly 10%, 15%, or even 25% affordable units in these hulking developments. We live in a democracy -- we can work on changing the system so that they and their investors have less power to dictate to the non-1%ers. If we don't change the winner-takes-all form of capitalism that we've allowed to develop in our country we won't solve the multiple crises confronting us: healthcare, housing, climate.

    "comment": " No. The property's current (TC-2) zoning only requires that 10%, or possibly it's 15%, of the units be affordable, and the LUMO says half of those must be at 60% AMI and the other half can be at 80% AMI. But the developers are prepared to commit to having 25% of the units affordable. That increase is why they are asking to have them all at 80% AMI. The tradeoff is 14 units at 80% AMI vs 3 or 4 at 60% and 3 or 4 at 80%.",

And it\u2019s also important to note that in the the current process, just about every project is \u201cnon-conforming\u201d in terms of zoning, so any project that anyone wants to build must jump through the conditional zoning hoops. Chapel Hill may be slightly different than Carrboro, where I\u2019m most familiar, but, in the case of Carrboro, the zoning essentially dates back to 1977.   I vaguely remember 1977. Crazy clothes and music. Probably not the year that encapsulates the best thinking about how to build an amazing town. So things have changed since then, and chapel Hill zoning should also not be rocking the polyester disco suit. A disco suit doesn\u2019t fit today\u2019s standards. \nAccordingly, why should I care about a downtown building that looks like a downtown building? Why should a downtown building have large setbacks? Life changes and our codes should change with them. \nAnd the thing about the current standards is that they aren\u2019t really what people want or what the council wants\u2014 they are there because nobody wants to build anything according to them and must, therefore, make a deal with the town to actually build something that someone wants. It\u2019s called pretextual zoning and it\u2019s not a great practice if you care about governance and democracy. It also produces poor quality results, Chapel Hill is a case study. I\u2019d rather have us decide what we\u2019d actually like to see and make clear and consistent rules about how it happens. \n\nOn the other hand, pretextual zoning is great if you want to gum up the works, block housing and change, keep town staff busy chasing rainbows, and keep people perpetually pissed off thinking they can control everything that gets built. Fun times. \n\n",

Generations of Council members attempted to change the situation and restore public trust by improving the consistency, predictability and transparency of the entitlement process. A large obstacle , however, is the limits imposed by the NC general assembly from inclusionary zoning for affordable housing, to tree protection and impact fees for schools and infrastructure (roads, transit, storm water, public facilities etc). Despite continuing effort of LUMO rewriting, almost 100% major development projects are now approved through conditional zoning, the messy, subjective, ad hoc process that frustrates everyone and generates poor results.",

I saw two specific claims about the sheet being \"misinformation\": that the Sierra Club's endorsement of Anderson was biased and had led someone to resign in protest, so that endorsement shouldn't have been included, and that organizations had been listed as endorsing candidates that actually hadn't. I'm relatively new to town politics and want to know who to trust, and the allegations sounded serious, so I looked into both claims. The first one seems straightforwardly false - what actually happened is that someone recused themselves from the endorsement process to avoid bias. The second one turned out to be semantics about CHALT's coy refusal to use the word 'endorse' for their support and activities in favor of Searing et al. So I came away from this trusting TBB, and seeing that some of it's critics/Searing's supporters had been incorrect and/or disingenuous. So if TBB really were leaving off important endorsements, I'd want to know about it.\n[EDIT: I was responding to a post claiming that key Searing endorsements had been left off; I asked which ones and said I didn't think that was true, and I was told that it was a moot point, but that it was definitely true.]",

The simplification of these issues -- usually into a straightforward application of supply and demand economics -- is coming from Hemminger et al on the Council. Adam and the slate seem to me to have a strong grasp of the complexities confronting us and a willingness to bring new perspectives to them. They all bring valuable experience of different kinds. Yes, town planning experience is valuable in local government but expertise can also bring narrowness of thought -- and IMO ordinary citizens should be included in town governance. A town council shouldn't be a panel of experts. Amy Ryan's experience is valuable, of course, but she voted for Aura and seems to me to have tunnel vision to more building as the answer to our problems. Aura includes parking for about 600 cars and will add about 3,000 more trips through the MLK/Estes intersection daily.",

Having to serve on a commission is not a requirement--not should it be.  There are lots of people in Chapel Hill with various kinds of experience, skills, and expertise to serve in such a post.  One of the problems we face is that far too many people in our town government have very limited life experience and perspectives that would have brought some common sense to the terrible decisions they have made that have resulted in displacing people and a $164 million defecit and the idea that as long as our credit is good we can keep borrowing.  Meanwhile over 100 streets are five years behind for resurfacing, our police, garbage and fire truck vehicles need to be replaced--and if the new 12 story apartment building is built downtown, we will need yet another fire truck to service it because of it's height.",

    "comment": " In 1991 when I first arrived in Chapel Hill, I learned from watching Town Council meetings, that there was going to be an onslaught of commuter traffic coming into town. Now there are over 20,000 daily trips (and was recently told the number has increased to 40,000) with expectations of that number increasing. At that time I was around planners with graduate degrees from UNC and later worked with some. Upon learning, we had bought a home in Chapel Hill, I was told (among other things) of the short-sighted planning in the town regarding commercial development on the perimeter of town when commuters were predictable. The town is a grid of mostly state roads designed to get traffic through town with few designed for internal trips. By the time I moved here, I knew the town was way behind in planning for affordable housing for teachers, town and UNC employees, police, and others. Coming from Montgomery County, MD developers starting in the 80s were working with affordable housing advocates to stop incorporating affordable housing in subdivisions but instead near public transportation. The states with some of the most interesting options for addressing housing and transportation solutions have state employees accessing federal money. Town elected officials, staff, and the public were engaged in conversations about workforce housing during planning for Carolina North. Those suggesting working with the state might have to wait until 2030. People advocating for affordable housing similar to what was accomplished in Asheville should look into the major role played by Roy Williams. I'm sure Bentonville has wonderful parks and recreation facilities, the also have access to Walton family money. I'm glad Adam helped getting Obamacare passed. Recently, I've met with lobbyists willing to share with me who in the US Congress is interested in policy (fewer than I would like), what are their interests, who are staff-driven, and who have the capacity to think of new ideas. It's an accomplishment to get legislation passed by Congress; it's a team effort at best with experienced people. If mayor, Adam does not get to choose his team and might have to build bridges to people whose veracity he has challenged.",

It is not clear to me why Adam does not think Council members understand there are financing constraints or why the consultant should be asked off topic questions. Jess is trying to stop the interruption and it takes 10 minutes for Pam to ask for the meeting to get back on topic. Over the past 2 years Adam has reminded people of his busy and fortunately for us successful legal career. His professional skills might not be transferable to local government.

Affordable housing in rental developments are temporary (20-30 years), which might give the town to develop a policy or housing.",

    "comment": " The town is guided by the Land Use Management Ordinance written 20 years ago. It is a legal framework being rewritten. Completing the exercise will give the town better ability to get the projects the town wants. Without the revisions and knowledge of its intricacies, developers have the advantage. Jon Mitchell, as chair of the Planning Commission, has used his analytical skills to create a matrix to clearly present to decision-makers choices being made. Jon will be a great town council member. Chapel Hill houses are a depreciating asset while its land is an appreciating asset. We are attracting investors buying our houses.  Some investors are selling the houses for almost $300k with a ground lease, meaning the landowner gets the profit. About ten years ago, local developers went through an exercise with members of the Housing Board and Planning Commission to determine what concessions would be required for the private sector to provide affordable housing. At the time median single family houses were over $300k now they are over $550k. Solutions are elusive.",

Chapel Hill has always had a varied supply of housing. It is only in recent years with the continued approval of expensive apartments that the housing balance has been upended. Poor leadership has allowed this to happen.",

The town does not control when owners decide develop or redevelop their property. Nor does the town have many tools to require owners to maintain their apartment complexes or commercial properties. It has been 20 years since the town wrote its current Land Use Management Ordinance (LUMO). Consultants are now working with the town council to create a legal framework for the new LUMO. Stopping the process keeps developers constructing buildings people don't like.",

How about the proposal to move our beloved CH Library to University Mall and use the Library Building and surrounds for town offices.  Reneging on a park would be small potatoes.  Keep it a park and 5 years from now have a referendum to see if people want to stick \"affordable\" housing there.  Till then, don't take from all the users so the few that could live \"in the park.\"",
